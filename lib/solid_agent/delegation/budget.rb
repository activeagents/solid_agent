    # Cost and latency limits for delegated work.
    #
    # A sub-agent is a loop inside a loop: the parent model decides how often
    # to call it, and each call spends tokens and wall-clock time nobody
    # explicitly authorized. A budget puts a ceiling on that — per delegation
    # and across the agent as a whole — so a runaway hand-off degrades into a
    # bounded answer instead of an unbounded bill.
    #
    # Every limit is optional; an empty budget imposes nothing.
    #
    # @example Per delegation
    #   delegate_to SummarizerAgent, budget: { max_calls: 3, max_tokens: 8_000, timeout: 20 }
    #
    # @example Across every delegation this agent makes
    #   delegation_budget max_calls: 10, max_duration: 60, max_cost: 0.25
    #
    # Cost budgets price themselves through {SolidAgent::ModelPricing}, which
    # already resolves rates from RubyLLM's registry with a static fallback —
    # so +max_cost+ works without configuring anything. Pass +rates:+ only to
    # override a specific delegation.
